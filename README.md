## What is the goal for cson?

We want to provide a build system that is easy to use and config for C++ beginners or who are not the programming prefessors, which can help them focus on their project and code instrendad of dealing with the build system configration.  
We only require a small number of essential fields for cson.json and make the build system configration as simple as possible.
